# Getting Started
Snorkel is a stunning approach to learning with unlabeled data. But the original library is very fragile. It has dependencies on old versions of PyTorch and Tensorflow.

Moreover, it has problems if you try to install it in windows (sometimes it is important). It will be better to make labeling with docker to prevent these troubles and other work outside. The [Snorkel tutorials](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials) repository has inspired this docker.
